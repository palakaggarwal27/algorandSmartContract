My dApp is a **Grocery List Manager** built on **Algorand** using TypeScript smart contracts.  
It allows users to easily **add, view, and clear grocery items** directly on-chain.  
This is a beginner-friendly example project that demonstrates how to use **Algorand smart contracts** and **global state storage** in a practical way.
